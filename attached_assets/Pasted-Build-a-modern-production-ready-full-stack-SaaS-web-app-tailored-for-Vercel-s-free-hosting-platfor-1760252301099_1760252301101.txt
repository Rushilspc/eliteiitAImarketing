Build a modern, production-ready, full-stack SaaS web app tailored for Vercel's free hosting platform. The website should be branded for the client ELITEIIT (an education provider). Use a primarily white design with blue as secondary, but do NOT use conventional AI-site styles; choose clean, modern, and distinct font styles (avoid Roboto; prefer Nunito, Montserrat, or similar). The UI must be uncluttered, easy for marketers and teachers to use.

Features:

AI Message Creator (Frontend + Backend):

Tool for generating promotional WhatsApp/SMS marketing messages with LLM (OpenRouter/meta-llama/llama-3.3-8b-instruct:free).

Input box for campaign ideas (e.g. “20% off all courses for Diwali”).

Dropdown/select for target platform (WhatsApp/SMS/Interakt).

On submit, calls backend API which:

Sends user idea and marketing context to OpenRouter Llama endpoint.

Formats response for selected platform, clearly marked for 'Interakt'.

Displays generated message and “Copy” button.

Backend can use Replit’s serverless .js file, Vercel’s api/message.js route, or similar.

AI Image Generator (Frontend + Backend):

Input for marketing image idea (e.g. “5th grade students in math class”).

On submit:

Sends image concept to OpenRouter Llama model, refines it to a prompt.

Shows the refined prompt on the page.

Sends prompt to Freepik’s AI image API: https://api.freepik.com/v1/ai/text-to-image/imagen3 (call with fetch/Axios, handle auth).

Displays generated image preview.

Button for “Download Image” (downloads given image).

Shows the refined prompt, with two buttons “Open in ChatGPT” and “Open in Gemini”; clicking these redirects the user with prompt text pre-filled for image generation on ChatGPT or Gemini.

User Authentication (Supabase):

Login page with email and password fields.

Integrate Supabase authentication using provided Supabase URL and key.

On login, show dashboard with authenticated user email.

No registration or user management required outside login/authenticate/logout.

No database needed for storing messages or images.

Other Requirements:

No persistent database besides Supabase auth.

App should be designed for instant deployment in Vercel: correct Next.js/React folder structure, /api serverless routes; all keys/envs read via Vercel environment variables.

Responsive, mobile-friendly.

All styling by CSS modules, Tailwind, or styled-components if possible.

Clear separation of frontend (React UI/Next.js pages) and backend (API routes for LLM, Freepik calls).

Instructions:

Start with Vercel-ready Next.js project template (npx create-next-app@latest).

Implement all backend features as /api serverless Vercel routes (/api/message.js and /api/image.js).

Ensure Supabase integration is using environment variables for URL and key.

Confirm Freepik API and OpenRouter endpoints are configurable via environment variables.

All fetch/request calls with error handling and status/loading indicators.

Clearly mark actionable buttons (Copy, Download, Open in ChatGPT/Gemini).

Use only free-tier features of all APIs/services.

Output full source code with all dependencies, so it can be pushed to GitHub and deployed directly on Vercel without modification.

Do NOT include any hard-coded secrets or keys.

Style Guidance:

Primary: white, Secondary: blue (#2563eb or similar).

Use Nunito or Montserrat font.

Avoid generic gradient backgrounds or illustrations.

Minimal, clear, modern layout.

Output Required:

Complete Vercel-ready project.

All code files validated.

Instructions for connecting GitHub and deploying on Vercel.
